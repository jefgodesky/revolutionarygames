		<p><em>Ruins &amp; Revolutions</em> is our forthcoming ultra-light
		ruleset that pushes play out of abstraction and mechanics and back
		into your world and characters, with a few key tools to make it easy
		to turn whatever happens next into a gaming experience with mechanical
		weight that goes exactly as deep as you like and no further. It&rsquo;s
		designed with maximum interoperability with popular existing tabletop
		roleplaying game systems in mind so you can build a new campaign with
		<em>Ruins &amp; Revolutions</em> from the start or switch the campaign
		that you&rsquo;ve been playing for years over to it with just a few
		hours&rsquo; notice.</p>

		<p><em>The Scarlet Banner</em> is a world that cries out for liberation
		from greedy dragons that hoard all the wealth, vampires who herd the
		common people like livestock, and theocracies who wield magic in the name
		of their gods to root out any who oppose their doctrines. While the
		elves, dwarves, orcs, and wizards will feel familiar to fans of modern
		fantasy, what sets <em>The Scarlet Banner</em> apart is its deep history,
		endless cultural diversity, and realistic treatment of how power really
			works &mdash; and what it really takes to overthrow it.</p>

		<p><em>The Fifth World</em> is 144,000 days (one
		<em>b&rsquo;ak&rsquo;tun</em> of the Maya calendar) from this moment.
			Over four centuries in the future, after the collapse of civilization
			and the Rusting Age that followed, the world has changed. Ice caps
			have melted, seas have swelled, and jungles have overtaken the ruins
			of the once-proud cities. Herds of elephants trample savannas in
			Canada and Russia. Tigers prowl the broken, overgrown ruins of
			London and Beijing. <em>The Fifth World</em> is an open source
			shared universe exploring a neotribal, ecotopian, animist realist
			vision of what our future could be.</p>
